# Bento Dashboard

> Educational Repository: This project contains intentionally seeded bugs and incomplete features across easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels. Perfect for learning React 19, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, and Zustand while practicing open source contributions.

## About This Project

Bento Dashboard is a modular, grid-based personal dashboard application where users can add and customize widgets including weather displays, sticky notes, pomodoro timer, task manager, calendar, and more. The application demonstrates modern React patterns, state management with Zustand, and responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning platform for developers who want to practice contributing to open source projects. Each issue is carefully crafted to teach specific concepts and skills while contributing to a real, functional application.

### Key Features

- **Modular Widget System**: Add, remove, and customize dashboard widgets
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Focus timer with customizable work/break intervals
- **Sticky Notes**: Create and manage colorful notes with different colors
- **Task Manager**: Todo list with priorities, due dates, and filtering
- **Weather Widget**: Current weather conditions with location search
- **Calendar**: Monthly calendar view with event tracking
- **Theme Support**: Light, dark, and system theme modes
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data across browser sessions

## Learning Objectives

By contributing to this repository, you will:

- Learn React 19 hooks and component patterns
- Practice state management with Zustand
- Work with Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes
- Write and debug TypeScript code
- Practice the full open source contribution workflow
- Understand testing with Vitest and Testing Library

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Git

### Installation

#### Standard Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anxkhn/bento-dashboard.git
cd bento-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm run dev

# Run tests (some will fail initially - that's expected!)
npm run test
```

#### Using pnpm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the application
pnpm dev
```

### Verification

After installation, you should see:

- The development server running at `http://localhost:5173`
- A dashboard with several default widgets
- The ability to add, remove, and interact with widgets

Note: Some tests will fail initially - this is intentional. Your job is to fix them by resolving the issues.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when setting up or running the application.

### Node Version Issues

**Problem**: Build fails with errors about unsupported syntax or modules.

**Cause**: The project requires Node.js 18+ for modern JavaScript features.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check your Node version
node --version

# If below 18, upgrade using nvm or download from nodejs.org
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

### Dependency Installation Problems

**Problem**: `npm install` or `pnpm install` fails with peer dependency errors.

**Cause**: Incompatible package manager or outdated lock file.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Try clearing node_modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Or try with pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install
```

### Build Errors

**Problem**: `npm run build` fails with TypeScript or ESLint errors.

**Cause**: Type mismatches or code style violations.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check for type errors
npm run type-check

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Port Already in Use

**Problem**: `npm run dev` fails with "Port 5173 is already in use".

**Cause**: Another process is using the default Vite dev server port.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Or specify a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Vite Server Not Starting

**Problem**: Vite dev server crashes immediately after starting.

**Cause**: Configuration issues or incompatible plugins.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```
